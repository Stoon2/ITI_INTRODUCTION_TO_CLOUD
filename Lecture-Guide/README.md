## üìÖ Day 1 ‚Äì Foundations & Core Services (3h Lecture)

### **1. Introduction to Cloud Computing (45 min)**
- Define **Cloud Computing** in simple terms
- Compare **IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS** with real-world analogies
- Explain **benefits**: scalability, elasticity, pay-as-you-go
- Introduce the **Shared Responsibility Model**
  - AWS vs Customer responsibilities
  - Example: AWS secures the data center, you secure your EC2 instance

**References**

**Reflection Questions**
- How does cloud computing differ from traditional on-premises infrastructure you may have used before?
- Which service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) do you think most companies adopt first, and why?
- In the Shared Responsibility Model, what‚Äôs one example of a security task AWS handles vs one you must handle?
